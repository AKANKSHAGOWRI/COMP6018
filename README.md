## Contents

The main contents of repository can be found in the `materials` directory. This contains the following subdirectories:

* `lectures` - the markdown source for the lecture slides
* `tutorials` - a set of jupyter notebooks covering the lecture material
* `labs` - the Jupyter notebooks used for the lab classes
* `solutions` - the solutions to the lab classes

## Using Git

If you have not used `git` before you may need to install it on your computer. The instructions depend on your operating system:

* **Linux**: For Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install git` and for Fedora run `sudo dnf install git`.
* **MacOS** (e.g., MacBooks): Install the latest version from [this list](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/) by clicking on the link.
* **Windows**: Follow the instructions at <https://gitforwindows.org/>

## Setting up your local environment

First clone the repositry to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UOS-COM-6018/COM6018.git
```

Then make a conda environment from the `com6018.environment.yml` file and activate it,

```bash
cd COM6018
conda env create -n com6018 -f com6018.environment.yml
conda activate com6018
```

You should now be able to open the `ipynb` files. For example, to open the first lab class run:

```bash
jupyter notebook  materials/labs/010_python_intro.ipynb
```
